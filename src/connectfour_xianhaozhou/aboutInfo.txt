About
This Connect Four game was created in April 2019, by Xianhao Zhou 
including the design, programming, and testing. It was completed 
with help troubleshooting and problem-solving from friends. 
				
If you have any questions about the game or the process of making 
it you can contact me by email or phone. Also please add any other 
comments or ideas to help me improve the game.
