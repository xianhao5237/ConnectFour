Instructions
This game is played by 2 players. Player 1 (RED) will go first by choosing
the column they would like to place their chip in by clicking on the button 
above the column. Their chip will then fall down to the lowest unoccupied 
space in that column. Then player 2 (YELLOW) will choose the column to 
place their chip in. They will continue to take turns until one player wins.
				
A player wins by connecting 4 or more of their pieces in a row horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally in any way. When a player wins a message will pop 
up declaring they won. Then you can click on the reset button at the bottom 
of the window to reset the board and play again.
