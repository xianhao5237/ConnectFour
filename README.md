# ConnectFour

This program will allow two users to play a game of connect four in the form of a 
graphical user interface (GUI). Player's 1 (red) and 2 (yellow) will take turns placing their chips
on to the board by clicking on the button above the column they want to place it in. Their chip 
will then fall to the lowest unoccupied slot in that column. A player wins when they get four or 
more of their pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Then a message will pop
up saying they won. Users will also be able to find the instructions, or about page by clicking
on the buttons at the bottom of the GUI. Also at the bottom of the GUI there is a button to 
reset the board to play again.
